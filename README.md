We're pleased to share with you that the Noteprise Android app was among the winners of the Salesforce Mobile Developer Challenge.

Though the contest is now over, we plan to continue to enhance and support Noteprise to transform it into an enterprise-grade Evernote to Salesforce mobile connector. Therefore, we're moving Noteprise development to a private Github repo.
